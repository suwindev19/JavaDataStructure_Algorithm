### Week 1: Strings Methods

- String in Java is a Class, but it is almost used like primitive data types such as int, float, long, etc.
- String is a collection of characters. 

- [String methods](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/java_lang_string.htm)

- **[java.lang.Character.isLetterOrDigit(char ch)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/character_isletterordigit.htm)**
  - The java.lang.Character.isLetterOrDigit(char ch) determines if the specified character is a letter or digit.
  - A character is considered to be a letter or digit if either Character.isLetter(char ch) or Character.isDigit(char ch) returns true for the character.
  - String.charAt(i)
- **Two Pointer Technique - one of the techniques**

  - int pointer i, increment
  - int pointer j, decrement

- **[java.lang.String.valueOf(char[] data)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/string_valueof_chararray.htm)**

  - The java.lang.String.valueOf(char[] data) method returns the string representation of the char array argument.
  - The contents of the character array are copied and subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created string.

- \***[String toCharArray() Method](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/12/java-string-tochararray-method-example/)**\*\*

  - The method toCharArray() returns an Array of chars after converting a String into sequence of characters.
  - The returned array length is equal to the length of the String and the sequence of chars in Array matches the sequence of characters in the String.

```
    public class CharArrayExample{
        public static void main(String args[]){
                String str = new String("Welcome to BeginnersBook.com");
                char[] array= str.toCharArray();
                System.out.print("Content of Array:");
                for(char c: array){
                    System.out.print(c);
                }
            }
    }
```
- Commonly Used methods 
  - int length()
  - String toLowerCase()
  - String toUpperCase()
  - String trim()
  - String substring(int begin)
  - String substring(int begin, int end)
  - String replace(char old, char new)
  - boolean startsWith(String s)
  - boolean endsWith(String s)
  - char charAt(int index) - return the char value at that particular index
  - int indexOf(String s)
  - int lastIndexOf(String s)
  - boolean equals(String s)
  - boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String s)
  - int compareTo(String s)
  - String valueOf(int i)

- length() vs length in Java
  - array.length : To obtain the array size and can be used for char[], double[], String[]
  - string.length() : length of the string and can be used for String, StringBuilder, etc.
    ```
    int[] array = new int[4]; 
        System.out.println("The size of the array is " + array.length); 

    String str = "Oishii"; 
    System.out.println("The size of the String is " + str.length()); 
  
    ```
### Week - 1: Arrays

In this week, the data structure is **Arrays**. Therefore 7 leetcode easy array questions were selected for practice. The problems numbers and links are below. (In progress)

### Arrays
- Abstract Data types
  - Model (logical description) for a certain data structure
  - Supertype in programming (interface in Java)
  - We define what methods / functions the data structure will have, so we define the basic behaviour 
  - It is just the model.
  - ADT does not specify the concrete implementation or programming language 
  - It is what the user knows.
  - For example
    - stack
      - push( )
      - pop( )
      - peek( ) 
  - Data structure are concrete implementation.
  - Acutal representation of the data 
  - The aim is to be able to store and retrive data in an efficient manner
  - What we want: 
    - insert/ find items in O(1) Time 
    - retrieve O(1) time
  
  | Abstract Data Types | Data Structures implementation |
  |---|---|
  | Stack | array, linked list |
  | Queue | array, linked list |
  |Priority Queue | heap| 
  | Dictionary/ Hashmap | array | 

  - Abstract data types are specifications.
  - Every abstract data type has data structure that will implement abstract data type.
- Arrays - A collection of elements/ values each identified by an array index or key.
  - index starts at 0
  - because of the indexes, random access is possible.
- Multidimensional array: very important for mathematical related computations (matrixes)
- numbers[][] two dimensional array
  - First parameter : row index 
  - second : column index
- Arrays are data structures in order to store items of the same type
- Use indices as key
- Arrays can have as many dimensions as we want: 1D or 2D arrays are quite popular 
- e.g. Storing a matrix -> 2D Array 
  - Dynamic array: size of the array is changing dynamically
  - Applications: Lookup tables/ hashtables, heaps
  - Abstract data structure such as Hashtable, heaps use array as underlying data structure.

- **Advantages of Array :** You can use random access because of the keys
  - getItem(int index) will return the value of the given key. It is very fast O(1)
  - Very easy to implement and to use
  - Very fast data structure 
  - You should use arrays in applications when you want to add items over and over again and want to take items with given indexes.
- **Disadvantages of Array :** You have to know the size of the array at compile-time
  - It is not a dynamic data structure.
  - If it is full, you have to create a bigger array and have to copy the values one by one
  - Therefore reconstructing an array is O(n) operation
  - It is not able to store items with different types
- **Arrays Operations :**
  - Add values to the array as long as the array is not full 
    - add( 12 )
    - add( 34 )
    - add( 120 )
    - add( -5 )
    - Insert at the end O(1) Time complexity 
  - Insert item at a given value at a given index 
    - index (23, 1) 
    - Need to shifts values in order to insert the new one
    - Therefore O(n) Time 
  - Remove the last item 
    - removeLast O(1)
    - removeValueAtGivenIndex O(n)
- **ArrayList :** It is one of the implementations of the list interface
  - An array stores the values in the background 
  - int[] array = new int[10];
  - random access / very fast O(1)
    - Random access : accessing items by the index | list.get(0)
  - It is equivalent to Vector but ArrayList is not synchronised.
  - All operations run in O(n) Time
  - But to remove the items, this operation is not so efficient because you need to shift each item in the list O(n)
  - If the application is just about adding elements to a list and getting elements with known indexes, then use arraylist
  - Capacity
    - It is a parameter you can define when you instantiate an ArrayList
    - It is the initialise size of the array
    - If you already know that you will store 5 million items in list, you should use with that size to void the incremental rellocation. (to reduce the amount of incremental rellocation)
    - list = new ArrayList(5000000)
- **Arrays :**
- Fundamental building blocks for all other data Structures
  - There are two types of Arrays: Static and Dynamic Arrays
- **Static array :** is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1].
- **indexable :** means that each slot/ index in the array can be referenced with a numbes. Static array are given as contagious chunck of memory.
- **When and where is a static Array used?**
  - Storing and accessing sequential data
  - Temporarily storing objects - most commonly used 
  - Used by IO routines as buffers
    - Store information from input and output streams 
    - If files are too large to fit in the memory, use Buffer to read small chunks 
  - Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
    - Due to array's indexing properties, you can retrieve data from the table.
  - Can be used to return multiple values from a function
    - Find way around in the programming lanaguge that allow for only single return value. 
    - Use as pointer and return the values 
  - Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems 
    - [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)
      - [Knapsack problem lecture notes for later reference](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring19/compsci330/lecture4scribe.pdf)
    - Queen check problem
- **Complexity :**
  
  | Operation | Static Array | Dynamic Array |
  |---|---|---|
  |Access | O(1) | O(1)|
  |Search | O(n) | O(n)|
  |Insertion | N/A | O(n)|
  |Appending | N/A | O(1)|
  |Deletion | N/A | O(n)|

  - Static Array: Insertion, Appending, Deletion do not apply to static array since it is a fixed size.
  - Dynamic Array : needs to shift the elements for both insertion and deletion.
- Array 
    ```
    A = {44, 12, -5, 17, 6, 0, 3, 9, 100}   <- Array
          0   1   3   3  4  5  6  7   8     <- Indexing
    A[0] = 44 , [] square bracket denotes the indexing 
    A at position 0 

    ```
- **Operations on Dynamic Array**
  - The dynamic array can grow and shrink in size.
  - A = {34, 4}
  - A.add(-7)      A = {34, 4, -7}
  - A.add(34)      A = {34, 4, -7, 34}
  - A.remove(4)    A = {34, -7, 34}

- **Implement Dynamic Array** 
  - One of the most common way to implement is to use a static array.
    - Create a static array with an initial capacity
    - Add elements to the underlying static array, keeping track of the number of elements
    - If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new static array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements into it.
- **Why is it important that we grow the size of the dynamic array exponentially when resizing?**
  - It is to keep the time complexity of insertions O(1). If we grow the array at an exponential rate, the cost of inserting as well as resizing becomes neglibigle.

### Linked Lists

**A Single node**
- contains data -> integer, double or custom object
- contains a reference pointing to the next node in the linked list
- Each node is composed of a data and a reference/ link to the next node in the sequence.
- Simple and very common data structure!
- They can be used to implement several other common data types: stacks, queues
- Simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random acccess to the data , therefore you cannot use indexes to get them.
- Many basic operations such as obtaining the last node of the list or finding a node that contains a given data or locating the place where a new node should be inserted - requires sequential scanning of most or all of the list elements


***Advantages***
- linked lists are dynamic data structures (array are not!)
- It can allocate the needed memory in run time
- Very efficient if we want to manipulate the first elements
- Easy implementation
- can store  items with different sizes : array assumes every element to be exactly the same
- It is easier for a linked list to grow organically. An array' size needs to be known ahead of time or re-created when it needs to grow


***Disadvantages***
- Waste memory because of references
- Node in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists have sequential access (array items can be reached via indexes in O(1) time !
- Difficulties arise in Linked Lists when it comes to reverse traversing.
- Singly linked list are extremely difficult to nagivate backwards
- Solution: Doubly linked lists -> easier to read, but memory is wasted in allocating space for a back pointer


### Linked List Operations

- inserting items at the beginning of the linked list
    - very simple, you just have to update the references -> O(1) Time complexity
    - linkedList.insertAtStart(10); 10 Null, insert 4 , point to 10 , set the pointer point to the next node
    - Array is great for random access
- inserting items at the end of the Linked List
    - You have to traverse the whole linked list to find the last node
    - How do you find the last node?
    - You know that the last node is pointing to NULL
    - You have to update the references when you get there O(n) Time
    - linkedList.insertAtEnd(25)
    - 12, 4, 123, -7, 10 , null
    - root of the node is 12. Have to go to the last node. Keep traversing until the pointer is pointing to null
    - 10 needs to point to item to be inserted (25) therefore O(1) + O(n) = O(n)

- Removing at the beginning
    - removing item at the beginning of the list is always very fast
    - you do not have to search the item
    - you have to update the references accordingly
    - O(1)
    - linkedList.removeStart()
- Removing at the given point
    - Search for the given item (which may take a lot of time
    - if the item is at the end of the list, O(n)
    - linkedList.reove(10)

- Doubly Linked List
    - We can get from 4 to 25 because we just have to hop to the next node.
    - Node class has two references, one pointing to the next node, one pointing to the previous node
    - It is not memory friendly, you have to store lots of references
    - But there is not need to track the previous node during traversal


### Linked List vs Array
**Searching**
  - Search operation yields the same result for both data structure
  - ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to LinkedList search operation
  - You can use random access arrays : getItem( int index) which is O(1) Time
  - LinkedList performance is O(n) Time
  - WHy?
  - ArrayList maintains index based system for its elment as it uses array data structure implicitly which makes it faster for searching an element in the list
  - On the other hand LinkedList requires the traversal through all the items for searching an element

**Deletion**
  - LinkedList remove operation takes O(1) time if we remove items from the beginning and usually this is the case
  - ArrayList : removing first element ( so at the beginning) takes O(n) time, removing the last item takes O(1) times
  - But on average, we have to reconstruct the array when removing
  - Therefore in conclusion, linkedlist is better for this option
  - Why?
  - Linked List basically operates with pointers : removal only requires change in the pointer location which can be done very fast
  
**Memory Management**
  - Arrays do not need any extra memory
  - LinkedList do need extra memory because of references / pointers
  - In this aspect, arrays are better, they are memory friendly.

| Operation   |            LinkedList  |            Arrays|
|---|---|---|
|Insert at the start |    O(1)  |                   O(n)|
|Insert at the end |      O(n)   |                  O(1)|
|Waste space     |        O(n)  |                   0|


**Interface**
- Interface is another way to achieve abstraction. 
- An interface is a completely abstract class that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.
- To access the interface methods, the interface must be implemented by another class with *implements* keybord.
- Interface cannot be used to create objects. 
- Interface does not have body.
- On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods. 
- Interface methods are by default abstract and public.
- Interface attributes are by default public, static and final. 
- Interface cannot contain a constructor. 
- 

**Why and When to use Interface?**
- To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface)
- You can achieve multiple interitance in Java via interface and implement multiple interfaces.


**Doubly Linked Lists**
- Doubly linked list are composed of nodes and references / pointeres from one node to the other!!
- The last and first references are pointing to a NULL
- You can access to the head
- You can access to tail as well.
- Single node
  - contains data -> integer, double or custom object
  - contains a reference pointing to the next node in the linked list
  - contains a reference pointing to the previous node in the linked list
- class Node {
  - data 
  - Node nextNode
  - Node previousNode
- }
- Singly Linked List
  - can only access from head ONLY => 12, 4, 123, -7, 25, NULL 
  - Time O(n)

  ```
      removeSingle(Node node, Node previousNode){
        tempNode = head;
        while (tempNode != null){
          if(tempNode == node){
            previousNode.nextNode = tempNode.nextNode;
            tempNode = null;
            return;
          }
          previousNode = tempNode;
          tempNode = tempNode.nextNode;
        }
      }
  ```
- Doubly Linked List
  - 7, 1, 10, -2, 2 
  - You don't need to traverse through the list
  - If you know the node you want to get rid of, you can update the reference because you can access the previous node with reference!

    ```
    removeDouble(Node node){
      node.previousNode.nextNode = node.nextNode;
      node.nextNode.previousNode = node.previousNode;
    }
    ```
**Advantages of Doubly Linked List**
  - a doubly linked list can be traversed both directions: forward and backward
  - the remove operation is more efficient if the node is given
  - for singly linked lists, you need the previous node.
  - to find it, you need to traverse the whole list
    - to remove a node from a singly linked list, you need the node + predecessor
    - to remove a node from a doubly linked list, you need the node 
  

**Collectoins**
- Iterable
  - Collection 
    - List
      - ArrayList
      - LinkedList - can implement queue and deque
      - Vector
        - Stack
    - Queue
      - Deque
      - ArrayDeque
      - PriorityQueue
    - Set 
      - Hashset
      - LinkedHashSet
      - SortedSet
      - TreeSet

**Real World practical applications of Linked List**
- Operating system uses almost all the important data structures.
  - Low level memory management 
    - Linked lists are important in low level memory management when dealing with C programming 
      - malloc() : allocate memory into heap
      - free() : free the memory 
    - With these built-in functions, we can manipulate the heap memory
      - char * char_ptr = (char*)malloc(30); // allocates 30 bytes of memory in the heap
    - Header  -> Header -> Header
    - B       -> B      -> B
    - O       -> O      -> O
    - D       -> D      -> D
    - Y       -> Y      -> Y
  - For more info, go to [this link](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Heap_Management).
- Windows application 
  - Alt + tab
  - All the tabs are linked together with linked list
- PhotoViewer - images are linked together
- Blockchains (bitCoin) - blockchain is basically a simple linked list where blocks are cryptographically linked together.
  - So the blockchain itself is a linked list with hash pointers
  - Every node in the blockchain has 2 hash values
    - Own hash
    - Hash value of the previous block 

### Week 1: Mathematical Questions 

- Find digit Counts in a number (See java file)
  - Iterative approach-Time O(n)
  - Recursive approach-Time O(n)
  - Logarithmic approach-Time O(1) **
  - Converting to String and count-Time O(n)
- **Arithmetic progression :** if the difference between any two consecutive terms are always the same, a sequence of numbers are said to be arithmetic progression
  - e.g.1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16
  - Initial term is the first number = a1 
  - Common difference = d 
  - **Find nth term of an arithmetic progression** 
  - an = a1 + (n -1) d
    - an = nth term
    - a1 = first term
    - n = term position 
  - Find sum of first n terms of Arithmetic progression
    - Sn = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]
      - Sn = sum of a term
      - a = first element
      - d = common difference 
      - n = numberof terms
    - Arithmetic mean = Sum of all terms / number of terms 
    - Sum of 'n' terms = n/2(first term + last term) = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]
- **Geometric Progression :** The ratio of any two consecutive terms are always the same.
- The next number in the series is calculated by multiplying a fixed number to the previous number in the series 
- 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
- 110, 220, 440, 880, 1760 (x 2)
- If common ratio is positive -> the terms will be the same sign as the initial term
- If common ratio is negative -> alternate between positive and negative.
- an = a1 * r^n-1
- Sum of nth term 
  - Sum = a(r^n -1)/ r-1
    - r = common ratio
    - n = number of terms
    - sum = sum of all geometric progression
