This file contains the list of Data Structure and Algorithms problems.

## Week 1 
### Problems
1. Sum of n natural numbers
   - Iterative approach , Time O(n), Space O(1)
   - Sum of consecutive numbers - n * (n + 1)/2 , Time O(1), Space O(1)
2. Leetcode 204: Count Prime numbers
   - n 
   - n/2
   - sqrt(n)
   - i * i <= n 

3. Find the smallest and second smallest elements in an array 
3. [Leetcode 42. Trapping Rain Water]()
4. [Leetcode 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List](https://leetcode.com/problems/decompress-run-length-encoded-list/)
   - Approach 1 
     - Go through the code

### Terminologies 
- Consider many cases 
  - Test for variety of scenario and different inputs  
  - Corner case (Edge case)
- Sorting algorithm - Test inputs
  - increasing
  - decreasing
  - no input 
  - one or two inputs
- Debugging skill 
  - Dry run - line by line implementation of code with different inputs
