Stability
Stable algorithms - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, MergeSort, etc..

    two items has same values, they should appear as per their original array
    objects have multiple fields - stability is important
    - it is not useful for integer.

Unstable algorithms - Selection Sort, QuickSort, HeapSort

Bubble Sort
- always compare adjacent element => array[i] > arr[i+1]
- always swap adjacent element, if they are the same, it is not going to swap. Therefore, it is stable


Selection Sort
- given an array, Find the maximum element in the array.
- swap the maxinum element with last element
- therefore, it is not stable
